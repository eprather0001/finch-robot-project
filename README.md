# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
We wanted the robot to change colors. We decided to make the tail blue, red, green, and teal. We also changed the beak to pink. We coded the robot to print a message out on the screen as well as playing a musical note. 
## Challenges faced and solutions
A challenge we faced was when we tried to play a sound on the robot. We wanted the sound to come out high pitched instead of low pitched. We had to mess around with the numbers which took awhile until we were able to get the sound to where we wanted it to be. 
## Future enhancements
If we had more time to work on this project we would try to make the robots dance more advanced. We would try to use more advanced code. We would also try to implment for-loops and make our code shorter and more organized.
